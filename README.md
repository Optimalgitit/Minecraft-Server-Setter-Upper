# Minecraft-Server-Setter-Upper
Sets up your minecraft server - Automatically.

Please note: You will need to download the Minecraft jars.
My video explains how to set everything up - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSwlrQbiQc&feature=youtu.be

This is fully-auto. You just have to execute the following command in your bash terminal and it will do the job:
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Optimalgitit/Minecraft-Server-Setter-Upper/master/setup-server.sh && ./setup-server.sh && rm setup-server.sh`
And that's it. You just set up a fully working vanilla Minecraft 1.14 server using just 1 command. HOW COOL IS THAT!
